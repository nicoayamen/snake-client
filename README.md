# Snake Client Project

My Snake Client repo and code that runs over the network. Made based off of the project for Lighthouse Labs Web Flex Bootcamp

## Installation

Before you can run the client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from 

```
git clone https://github.com/nicoayamen/snek-multiplayer.git
cd snek-multiplayer
npm install
npm run play
```

## Getting Started
- Clone my snake-client
- Run the server first
- Run the development snake client using the `node play.js` command within the `snake-client` directory second.
- Make sure to have `snek_mulitplayer` and `play.js`on seperate terminal instances
- Lastly, and most importantly, have fun!

## Usage
- WASD is used to move around the game world. (W = up, S = down, A = left, D = right)
- Get your snake to the red boxes to grow and avoid yourself and the wall
- Should your snake hit the wall or itself, its game over!
- To replay, run `node play.js` again inside for you play terminal instance
